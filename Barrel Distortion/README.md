Barrel Distortion
===
A simple barrel distortion image effect useful for creating virtual reality games for head-mounted displays. 

The script is located under Component > Image Effects > Displacement.

There are two parameters: Auto and FOV_Radians.
The second parameter is used for the shader and should be set to the camera's field of view in radians (not necessarily, you can experiment with its value).
The first one sets the second parameter automatically (according to the FOV of the camera the script is attached to).
